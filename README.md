This repository contains the code for my implementation of the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). 

The book is a great resource for learning about interpreters and compilers. It builds a language called Lox in Java and C.  

Later on, I will try to implement the Lox language in Dart as well for my own learning purposes.
